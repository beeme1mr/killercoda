## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

In this tutorial, you have built an OpenFeature compliant feature flag backend using flagd.

You now have a pure GitOps feature flagging system. You can change only a JSON file and your application will automatically leverage the changes.

This is just the beginning. flagd is capable of a lot more, such as providing multiple flag sources, local file usage or retrieval over HTTPS or gRPC.
